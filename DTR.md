# DTR: Define the Relationship
Use this template to when conducting DTR with your project partners. It's recommended that you copy/paste this template into your own gist each time you conduct a DTR to take notes on the conversation.

### Guiding Questions to Define The Relationship:
* What are your learning goals for this project? What drives us in this project?
* What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?
   * Pair to start - get things setup, identify database structures, divide up ownership 
   * Tackle things independently first, then collaborate when we hit roadblocks 
   * Sync up daily to align on progress
* How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?
   * Joe: Direct, open, specific feedback
   * Aliya: Straightforwardness, prefers professional and specific feedback shared with context 
* How would you describe your work style?
   * When pairing, let the coder work through challenges on their own, wait until they ask for help to chime in (aside from small typos, e.g.)
      * Communicate about this in the moment also 
* What are your strengths? How can our strengths complement each other?
* What's gone well or poorly in your previous projects?
* How will we set direction and make decisions as a team?
* How will we overcome obstacles?
* What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?
* What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences?
    * Aliya: 8am-8pm Turing hours; 8-9am isn't great for meeting, prefer to meet after school.
    * Joe: Prefer to meet after school; T/R 6:30-8:30 doing ICs, M/W/R 6:30-7 busy; 
    * Meeting schedule: 
       * Meet daily 10-15m daily 5 minutes after the last scheduled school event
* What is your style for giving feedback? Does anything ever hold you back from giving feedback?
* What do you identify as being your biggest strength(s) technically, as they relate to this project? Where do you feel you could use improvement in your technical skills, as they relate to this project? How can our team help support you in improving these skills?   
    * Aliya: past experience with SQL, comfort with relational databases  
* What tools do you want to use to manage the project?
    * When we pair, we'll use Pomodoro method: 45 minutes working / 5 minute breaks 
* How do you want the group to solve problems when members run into issues with features of the project?
* How do you know if a project is successful? How can we achieve that as a group?
* How will we recognize each other's successes and celebrate them?
